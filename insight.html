                <h2> Introduction</h2>
                <p>Water scarcity is one of the most pressing challenges of our time. Agriculture, which is the backbone
                    of most economies, relies heavily on water for irrigation. With the growing pressure on water
                    resources, it becomes vital to understand how much water is available and how efficiently it is
                    being used.</p>
                <p>In many regions, surface and groundwater supplies are shrinking due to overuse, pollution, and
                    climate change. This puts immense strain on food production and overall water sustainability.
                    Without precise knowledge of water availability and consumption patterns, effective management
                    becomes impossible.</p>

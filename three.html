                <p>
                    Users can calculate their personal water footprint by responding to a series of straightforward
                    questions about their daily activities, such as the types of food they consume, their water
                    usage
                    habits, and lifestyle choices. This interactive process provides a clear understanding of how
                    much
                    water is used directly and indirectly in their routine, helping them identify areas where they
                    can
                    reduce consumption and adopt more sustainable practices.</p>
